<condition name="backing">
  Neither Digitalis Data Services, nor SourceForge, actually issue the
  currencies or digital assets, and they do not back any of the same. 
  You are solely responsible for whom you choose to trade with. 
</condition>

<condition name="audit">
  Open Transactions software is open source, and
  code audits are randomly performed by hackers in the 
  open source community. Fellow Traveler (the author of the
  software) also uses Valgrind. 
</condition>

<condition name="rate">
  Hopefully at some point some kind of fee structure will be
  implemented to support the running of the server. Possibly
  something similar to loom's usage-tokens but if so we would
  probably use bitNicKeLs for the purpose (as that is the kind
  of purpose for which bitNicKeLs were intended).
</condition>

<condition name="liability">
  Issuers are solely liable to perform according to
  the conditions specified in their asset contracts.
</condition>

<condition name="mint">
  Float - the total quantity of any digital asset outstanding -
  is created by the issuer from his own mint, and signed by his
  private key.

  Disbursements from the Mint account are to be made on receipt of
  duly signed and public authorization from the Issuer.  All
  disbursements from the Mint account are to be made to the single
  Currency Comptroller account identified by the authorization.

  From time to time, the Currency Comptroller may direct the
  Currency Manager to return digital assets to the Mint
  for the express purpose of reducing the float. Digital assets
  so delivered are to be deposited into the Mint account,
  thus reducing the float by that amount.
</condition>

<condition name="privacy">
  The purchase, redemption and trading at Digitalis OT server
  normally are done on the basis of strong privacy. We try to
  never release any of your information unless compelled by law.
</condition>
